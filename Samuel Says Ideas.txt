Conditions:

RED:
- display sequence is .-.
- red appeared in every displayed sequence so far
- number of dashes in modified sequence equal to indicator count
- module on the bomb with "red" in the name (word or part of one)
- otherwise.

YELLOW:
- display sequence is -.--
- stage number equal to battery count
- simon shouts or simon sends present
- more than one yellow in display sequence
- otherwise.

GREEN:
- display sequence is --.
- *this* green in position two in display sequence
- this is the first green so far
- number of dots in modified sequence equal to distinct port types
- otherwise.

BLUE:
- display sequence is -...
- *any* blue in position three in display sequence
- display sequence does not form a valid morse letter << Can put letter-related rules after after this condition.
- every colour appears in sequence display OR modified sequence
- otherwise.


Quirks:

Glitched		- Buttons press themselves. Use button sequence to determine the position in the sequence to submit (instead of edgework)
Stutter		- Each symbol flashes several times before moving to the next (all symbols different). Use the different numbers to somehow modify the sequence
Virus		- No colours (all purple). Use submissions so far to decide colour sequence
Unstable		- One of the symbols alternates between being a dash and a dot. Go through the rules with both cases and combine the results (need to decide how)
Overclocked	- No pause between flashes. Sometimes the "first" colour will flicker. The symbols have been shifted right (but not the colours)
Discoloured	- Small screen goes gray (or some other colour). Blue -> Green -> Yellow -> Red -> Blue
Stuck		- One button is pushed in. Use this as an extra colour to use in the rules. Whether dot or dash is decided by edgework/stage number etc.


Grey Button:

- Mute button
- On strike, this button exits recovery mode
- This is the break button (press between letters in stage 5).


Small Screen:
- Show non-important emoticon probably
- Indicate discoloured quirk
- Press this screen instead if need to press stuck button.
- Indicate when button held long enough for a dash. Indicate also with an audio cue.


Stages 1-4:
- Use conditions to submit one symbol and colour
- Use quirk to modify display sequence


Stage 5:
- Use previous submissions to modify the display sequence
- Use all displayed quirks to modify the sequence
- Submit nato spelling of letter with a colour sequence.


Submission method:
- Hold for long enough to get a dash
- Release early for a dot
