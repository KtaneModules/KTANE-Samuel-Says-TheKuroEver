Glitched		- Everything looks normal. Press the small screen to reveal two colours to swap with each other.
Stutter		- Each symbol flashes several times before moving to the next (all symbols different). Use the different numbers to somehow modify the sequence.
Virus		- No colours (all purple). Use submissions so far to decide colour sequence.
Unstable		- One of the symbols alternates between being a dash and a dot. Go through the rules with both cases and combine the results (need to decide how)
Overclocked	- No pause between flashes. Sometimes the "first" colour will flicker. The symbols have been shifted right (but not the colours).
Cracked		-
