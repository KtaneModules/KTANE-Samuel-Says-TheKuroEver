Hey, this is my second module, Samuel Says! Idea by TheBigBadBull#7463 on Discord.

To report bugs, please contact Kuro#2011 on Discord.

To get started making modules, join the [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://discord.gg/ktane) or the [KTaNE Modding](https://discord.gg/qzy7Gdz) Discord servers.

Yes, there are like 5 million files which I don't think (think) is normal for modules, especially given that this one isn't super complicated or anything, but I must say it did make implementing a lot of things, especially the quirks, much easier for me (also I'm still new to making modules and just unity in general haha).

If you are looking through the source for a potential bug or manual clarification, your best bet is probably SamuelSequenceModifier.cs as this is where correct responses are calculated. Problems with quirks are likely located in their respective <Name>Quirk.cs files.
If it is not immediately urgent (ie. you're not currently defusing a bomb with this module on it), it's probably better to just let me know on Discord as above.

Since Samuel Morse was American, I have unfortunately been forced to spell the word "colour" incorrectly in the manual and logging, but you'd best believe I have spelt it correctly in my variable and class names <3
