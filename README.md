Hey, this is my second module, Samuel Says! Idea by TheBigBadBull#7463 on Discord.

To report bugs, please contact Kuro#2011 on Discord.

To get started making modules, join the [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://discord.gg/ktane) or the [KTaNE Modding](https://discord.gg/qzy7Gdz) Discord servers.

If you are looking through the source for a potential bug or manual clarification, your best bet is probably SamuelSequenceModifier.cs as this is where correct responses are calculated. Problems with quirks are likely located in their respective <Name>Quirk.cs files.
If it is not immediately urgent (ie. you're not currently defusing a bomb with this module on it), it's probably better to just let me know on Discord as above.
