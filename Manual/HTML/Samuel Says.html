                    This modules houses a device with a large color display above four colored buttons, with a
                    smaller
                    display and gray button to the right.
                </p>

                        style="text-decoration: none;">Samuel Finley Breese Morse</a>
                    has been trapped in this device and needs your help to escape! Fortunately, he is also the creator
                    of the device and knows how to
                    get out. Unfortunately however, his only means of communication is through colored morse. Your
                    job is to transmit different
                    parts of sequences to help him disarm the module.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good luck! Press the gray button to start.
                </p>

                <h3>Stages 1-4</h3>

                <p>
                    In these first four stages, take Samuel's transmitted messages and modify them to
                    produce one colored symbol (per stage),
                    which you then transmit back to him. Remember the colors of these symbols; you'll need them for
                    the final stage.
                </p>

                <h4>Sequence Modification</h4>

                <p>
                    Each stage, go through the colors in the <b>displayed sequence</b>, in the flashed order, and go to
                    the corresponding table below.
                    Find the first true <b>condition</b> in the table and look at the corresponding <b>action</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If this action has not been applied yet <i>this stage</i>, apply it to the modified sequence, or the
                    displayed sequence if this is
                    the first action. Otherwise, move <i>up</i> through the table, wrapping back to the bottom row if
                    needed, until you reach an action
                    that has not yet been applied, and apply it.
                </p>

                <h4>Determining Position</h4>

                <p>
                    The correct position to submit is X, modulo the length of the modified sequence,
                    plus one, where the value of X depends on the current stage:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In stage 1, X is the number of batteries.</li>
                    <li>In stage 2, X is the number of ports.</li>
                    <li>In stage 3, X is the number of indicators.</li>
                    <li>In stage 4, X is the total number of modules.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Submission</h4>

                <p>
                    To submit a colored symbol, press the button of the relevant color. To submit a
                    dash, hold the button until the small display on the right shows a <code>ー</code>;
                    to submit a dot, release the button before this happens.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the submission is correct, Samuel will accept the response and attempt to transmit
                    a new sequence. However, the device is riddled with oddities, so a <b>quirk</b> may show
                    up after each stage. Read the next subsection for more information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the submission is incorrect, Samuel will not accept the response, and the module will strike.
                    The displayed sequence and correct response will remain the same.
                </p>

                <h4>Quirks</h4>

                <p>
                    If a quirk appears after a correct submission, Samuel will exhibit some visual indicator
                    of the quirk. Respond in the correct way to nullify the quirk and move on to the next stage.
                    Remember which quirks show up, as you'll need them for the final stage.
                </p>

                <p>An incorrect response will cause a strike and reset input.</p>

                <h3>Stage 5</h3>

                <p>
                    After four correct submissions, Samuel needs an entire word to be transmitted, so he
                    can use it to finally escape the device and disarm the module.
                </p>

                <h4>Determining the Word</h4>

                <p>
                    Take only the symbols in the displayed sequence, ignoring the colors. If this sequence
                    does not form a valid morse letter, the correct word is <code>SAMUEL</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Otherwise, based on the quirk(s) that appeared earlier, modify this sequence, and convert it into a
                    letter.
                    Take this letter's spelling in the NATO Phonetic Alphabet to use as the word.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If no quirks appeared, leave the sequence as is.</li>
                    <li>If only one quirk appeared, remove the first position.</li>
                    <li>
                        If only two quirks appeared, and they were different, shift the sequence to the
                        right by two.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </div>

                <span class="page-header-section-title">Samuel Says</span>
            </div>
            <div class="page-content">

                <ul>
                    <li>If only two of the same quirk appeared, reverse the sequence.</li>
                    <li>If three distinct quirks appeared, remove the first three positions.</li>
                    <li>If three quirks appeared, and only two were the same, remove the third position.</li>
                    <li>If three of the same quirk appeared, remove the first two positions.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If the sequence is now empty, or does not form a valid morse letter, use
                    <code>MORSE</code> as the word.
                </p>

                <h4>Submission</h4>

                <p>
                    Convert the entire word into morse code, without any breaks between letters.
                    Input these symbols into the module, using the color of the first regular submission
                    for the first symbol, the color of the second regular submission for the second symbol,
                    and so on. Wrap back around to the first submitted color upon running out of colors.
                </p>

                <p>When reaching the end of a letter, the small symbol will display the submitted letter.</p>

                <p>
                    Correctly submitting the entire word will release Samuel from his prison and solve the module.
                    Upon submitting an incorrect symbol, the module will strike and the buttons will flash the
                    expected color order one time. Input will be reset but the displayed sequence and answer will
                    not change.
