                <p>
                    This modules consists of a device with a large color display above four colored buttons, with a smaller
                    display and gray button to the right. The colors are always red, yellow, green, and blue,
                    left-to-right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse" style="color: black;text-decoration: none;">Samuel Finley Breese Morse</a>
                    has been trapped in this device and needs your help to escape! Fortunately, he is also the creator of the device and knows how to
                    get out. Unfortunately however, his only means of communication is through morse and colors. Your job is to transmit different
                    parts of sequences to help him disarm the module.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good luck! Press the gray button to start.

                <h3>Stages 1-4</h3>

                <p>
                    In these first four stages, you need to take Samuel's transmitted messages and modify them to produce one colored symbol (per stage),
                    which you then transmit back to him. Remember the colors of these symbols, as you will need them for the final stage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each stage, go through the colors in the <b>displayed sequence</b>, in the flashed order, and go to the corresponding table below.
                    Find the first true <b>condition</b> in the table and look at the corresponding <b>action</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If this action has not been applied yet <i>this stage</i>, apply it. Otherwise, move <i>up</i> through the table, wrapping back
                    to the bottom row if needed, until you reach an action that has not yet been applied, and apply it.
                </p>
